# PostgreSQL Relational Database & Bash shell
## Salon Appointment Scheduler program

This 'Build a Salon Appointment Scheduler' SQL relational database & bash shell project is part of the freeCodeCamp 'Relational Database' curricumlum and certification.

In this solution I have created an interactive Bash program that uses PostgreSQL to track the customers and appointments for a salon.

The project was done in a virtual Linux machine using gitpod and after completing the project and all the described user stories successfully,
I have saved all the required files into this public repository and submitted the solution URL.

These are the files resulting from the completion of the project:
- [salon .sh bash shell program](./salon.sh)
- [salon .sql PostgreSQL database dump](./salon.sql)
- [insert services .sh script](./insert_services.sh)
- [create salon database structure .sh script](./create_database_structure.sh)
- [output examples text file](./output_examples.txt)
