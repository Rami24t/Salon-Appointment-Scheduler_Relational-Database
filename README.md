PostgreSQL Relational Database and BASH shell | Salon Appointment Scheduler


This 'Build a Salon Appointment Scheduler' SQL relational database & bash shell project is part of the freeCodeCamp 'Relational Database' curricumlum and certification.
In this project I have created an interactive Bash program that uses PostgreSQL to track the customers and appointments for a salon.

The project was done in a virtual Linux machine using gitpod and after completing the project and all the described user stories successfully,
I have saved all the required files into this public repository and submitted the solution URL.

These are the files resulting from the completion of the project:
- [salon .sh bash shell program](https://github.com/Rami24t/Salon-Appointment-Scheduler_Relational-Database/blob/main/salon.sh)
- [salon .sql PostgreSQL database dump](https://github.com/Rami24t/Salon-Appointment-Scheduler_Relational-Database/blob/main/salon.sql)
- [insert services .sh script](https://github.com/Rami24t/Salon-Appointment-Scheduler_Relational-Database/blob/main/insert_services.sh)
- [create salon database structure .sh script](https://github.com/Rami24t/Salon-Appointment-Scheduler_Relational-Database/blob/main/create_database_structure.sh)
